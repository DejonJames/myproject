Upon accessing the application, users are greeted with a welcoming landing page. This webpage serves as the entry point to the application and provides users with an initial introduction to the platform. It may contain relevant information, branding elements, or introductory messages to engage users.
Users are encouraged to proceed to the form page from the welcome page by clicking a designated link or button. This transition directs them to a page where they can input specific information or data using a form interface. Depending on the application's purpose or requirements, the form may request various details.
After completing the form with the necessary information, users submit it by clicking a designated button. This action triggers the submission process, where the entered data is processed and stored as needed. The system validates the form data and handles any errors or issues encountered during submission.
Upon successfully submitting the form, users are redirected to a confirmation page. Here, they receive feedback indicating whether the form was sent successfully or if there were any errors during the submission process. This confirmation message ensures users are informed about the status of their actions and provides reassurance regarding completing the desired task.
